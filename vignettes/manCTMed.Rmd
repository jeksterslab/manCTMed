## Description

Research compendium for the manuscript Pesigan, I. J. A., Russell, M. A., & Chow, S.-M. (2025). Inferences and Effect Sizes for Direct, Indirect, and Total Effects in Continuous-Time Mediation Models. *Psychological Methods*. https://doi.org/10.0000/0000000000

## Acknowledgments

This research was made possible by the Prevention and Methodology Training Program (PAMT) funded by a T32 training grant (T32 DA017629 MPIs: J. Maggs & S. Lanza) from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the National Institutes of Health Intensive Longitudinal Health Behavior Cooperative Agreement Program U24AA027684, National Science Foundation grants DUE-2417294, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences under UL1TR002014-06, and the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive & Kidney Diseases under U01DK135126.

Computations for this research were performed on the Pennsylvania State University's Institute for Computational and Data Sciences' Roar supercomputer. See `.sim/README.md` and the scripts in the `.sim` folder in the [GitHub](https://github.com/jeksterslab/manCTMed) repository for more details on how the simulations were performed.

## Installation

## Author-Accepted Manuscript

See https://github.com/jeksterslab/manCTMed/blob/main/.setup/latex/manCTMed-manuscript.Rtex for the latex file of the manuscript. See https://github.com/jeksterslab/manCTMed/blob/latex/manCTMed-manuscript.pdf for the compiled PDF.

## R Package

Effect sizes, standard errors and confidence intervals for the direct, indirect, and total effects for continuous-time mediation models as well as visualization tools are available in the `cTMed` package available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) ([https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cTMed](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cTMed)). Documentation and examples can be found in the accompanying website ([https://jeksterslab.github.io/cTMed](https://jeksterslab.github.io/cTMed)).
