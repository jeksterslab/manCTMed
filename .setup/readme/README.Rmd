## Description

Research compendium for the manuscript Pesigan, I. J. A., Russell, M. A., & Chow, S.-M. (2025). Inferences and Effect Sizes for Direct, Indirect, and Total Effects in Continuous-Time Mediation Models. *Psychological Methods*. https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000779

## Acknowledgments

This research was made possible by the Prevention and Methodology Training Program (PAMT) funded by a T32 training grant (T32 DA017629 MPIs: J. Maggs & S. Lanza) from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the National Institutes of Health Intensive Longitudinal Health Behavior Cooperative Agreement Program U24AA027684, National Science Foundation grants DUE-2417294, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences under UL1TR002014-06, and the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive & Kidney Diseases under U01DK135126.

Computations for this research were performed on the Pennsylvania State University’s Institute for Computational and Data Sciences’ Roar supercomputer using SLURM for job scheduling (Yoo et al., 2003), GNU Parallel to run the simulations in parallel (Tange, 2021), and Apptainer to ensure a reproducible software stack (Kurtzer et al., 2017, 2021). See `.sim/README.md` and the scripts in the `.sim` folder in the [GitHub](https://github.com/jeksterslab/manCTMed) repository for more details on how the simulations were performed.

## Installation

## Author-Accepted Manuscript

See https://github.com/jeksterslab/manCTMed/blob/main/.setup/latex/manCTMed-manuscript.Rtex for the latex file of the manuscript. See https://github.com/jeksterslab/manCTMed/blob/latex/manCTMed-manuscript.pdf for the compiled PDF.

## R Package

Effect sizes, standard errors and confidence intervals for the direct, indirect, and total effects for continuous-time mediation models as well as visualization tools are available in the `cTMed` package available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) ([https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cTMed](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cTMed)). Documentation and examples can be found in the accompanying website ([https://jeksterslab.github.io/cTMed](https://jeksterslab.github.io/cTMed)).

## More Information
