This vignette accompanies Illustration 1. The goal of the illustration is to calculate the direct, indirect, and total effects from the continuous-time vector autoregressive model drift matrix $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ and process noise covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ for a specific time interval or a range of time intervals. This example features the `Med` and `MedStd` functions from the `cTMed` package.

```{r}
#| include = FALSE
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  fig.path = "fig-vignettes-example-1-",
  fig.cap = "",
  fig.width = 8.5 / 1.5,
  fig.height = 11 / 2.5,
  fig.retina = 2,
  dpi = 300,
  comment = "#>",
  dev = "ragg_png"
)
```

```{r}
#| include = FALSE
root <- rprojroot::is_rstudio_project
```

```{r}
#| include = FALSE
library(dynr)
library(cTMed)
```

```{r}
#| eval = FALSE
library(cTMed)
```

## Continuous-Time Vector Autoregressive Model Estimates

The object `fit` contains the fitted `dynr` model. Data is generated using the `manCTMed::IllustrationGenData` function. The model was fitted using the `manCTMed::IllustrationFitDynr`.

```{r}
#| include = FALSE
fit <- readRDS(
  root$find_file(
    ".setup",
    "data-raw",
    "manCTMed-illustration-fit-dynr-00001-00001.Rds"
  )
)
```

```{r}
summary(fit)
```

## Extract Elements of the Drift Matrix and the Process Noise Covariance Matrix

We extract the elements of the drift matrix and the process noise covariance matrix from the `fit` object.

```{r}
# drift matrix
phi <- matrix(
  data = coef(fit)[
    c(
      "phi_11",
      "phi_21",
      "phi_31",
      "phi_12",
      "phi_22",
      "phi_32",
      "phi_13",
      "phi_23",
      "phi_33"
    )
  ],
  nrow = 3
)
# column names and row names are needed to define the indirect effects
colnames(phi) <- rownames(phi) <- c(
  "conflict",
  "knowledge",
  "competence"
)
```

```{r}
# process noise covariance matrix
sigma <- matrix(
  data = coef(fit)[
    c(
      "sigma_11",
      "sigma_12",
      "sigma_13",
      "sigma_12",
      "sigma_22",
      "sigma_23",
      "sigma_13",
      "sigma_23",
      "sigma_33"
    )
  ],
  nrow = 3
)
```

## Direct, Indirect, and Total Effects of a Time Interval of Three

Using the `Med` function from the `cTMed` package, the direct, indirect, and total effects for a time interval of three are given below.

```{r}
Med(
  phi = phi,
  from = "conflict",
  to = "competence",
  med = "knowledge",
  delta_t = 3
)
```

## Direct, Indirect, and Total Effects of a Time Interval of Zero to Ten

Using the `Med` function from the `cTMed` package, the direct, indirect, and total effects for a range of time interval values from 0 to 10 are plotted below.

```{r}
med <- Med(
  phi = phi,
  from = "conflict",
  to = "competence",
  med = "knowledge",
  delta_t = seq(from = 0, to = 10, length.out = 1000)
)
plot(med, legend_pos = "bottomright")
```

## Standardized Direct, Indirect, and Total Effects of a Time Interval of Three

Using the `MedStd` function from the `cTMed` package, the standardized direct, indirect, and total effects for a time interval of three are given below.

```{r}
MedStd(
  phi = phi,
  sigma = sigma,
  from = "conflict",
  to = "competence",
  med = "knowledge",
  delta_t = 3
)
```

## Standardized Direct, Indirect, and Total Effects of a Time Interval of Zero to Ten

Using the `Med` function from the `cTMed` package, the standardized direct, indirect, and total effects for a range of time interval values from 0 to 10 are plotted below.

```{r}
med_std <- MedStd(
  phi = phi,
  sigma = sigma,
  from = "conflict",
  to = "competence",
  med = "knowledge",
  delta_t = seq(from = 0, to = 10, length.out = 1000)
)
plot(med_std, legend_pos = "bottomright")
```
